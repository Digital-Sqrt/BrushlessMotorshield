# Description

The Brushless Motorshield facilitates the control of a brushless motor with high performance (up to 46 A per phase). Furthermore so-called brushless gimbal motors can be controlled. For a quick and easy start, an open source Arduino library with sample programs is available.

**Features**

* Control of a brushless motor (BLDC Motor)
* Control of a Brushless Gimbal Motor
* Voltage supply range: 7.4 -14.8 V
* Can be used with 2S, 3S and 4S LiPo-battery
* High performance: Maximum continuous output current per phase: 46 A
* Motor drivers are protected against short circuit (to ground/supply), overheating, overvoltage and undervoltage
* Arduino Library with example programs is available on GitHub
